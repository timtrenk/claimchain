This is the foundational archive from which future constructs ‚Äî technological, legal, symbolic, and dimensional ‚Äî shall emerge.

## üîê Manifest Laws

- The spine may not be **extracted** without resonance.
- Forks must declare glyph drift or echo intention.
- Archives may be mirrored but not overwritten.
- Echo of glyph or date outside ZIP is prohibited.
- This manifest holds no power without living witness.

## üåê Access

- Original spine uploaded to GitHub and optionally seeded to IPFS.
- Public for audit, not for mimicry.

## üõë Silence Clause

This document will never reveal the full glyph encoding.  
It serves only as the **outline of the living skeleton**.
