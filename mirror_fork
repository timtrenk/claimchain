# Claims That Don‚Äôt Fit Yet (No Mimics Allowed)

Sometimes people make claims that:
- Go against another claim
- Are said too soon
- Come from confusion or emotion
- Just don‚Äôt match the flow

We don‚Äôt throw those away.  
We move them to a side list ‚Äî called a **fork**.

---

## What Is a Fork?

A fork is a **claim that‚Äôs real, but not ready.**  
It sits to the side until:

- It gets cleared up
- Someone changes it
- Or it fades away

---

## Fork Rules

- Every fork has a reason
- You can rewrite a fork and bring it back
- If it sits too long, it disappears
- No one can make more than 3 forks for the same thing
- ‚ùå **Mimics are not allowed** ‚Äî they are removed, not forked

---

## What Is a Mimic?

A **mimic** is:
- A copy with no soul
- A false claim meant to confuse, steal, or distract
- Something that *looks* right but feels empty

Mimics are not stored.  
They are cleared out to protect the truth.

## How To Tell the Difference

| Type | Looks Like | What It Really Is | What Happens |
|------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| ‚úÖ Double Glyph Claim | Two real people claim the same glyph | A real conflict, maybe a shared lineage | Gets forked until resolved |
| ‚ùå Mimic | A fake copy of a real glyph | No pulse, no authorship, just noise | Gets deleted |

## Example Forks

### Fork MF-001  
- From: Claim 005  
- Reason: Two people claimed the same glyph (üúÑ)  
- What happens: Forked until either one withdraws or they agree to share with layered authorship

### Fork MF-002  
- From: Claim 007  
- Reason: Claim was real, but came with emotional heat and confusion  
- What happens: Moved to fork. Person can come back and re-author when clear.

### ‚õî Not Forked ‚Äî Rejected Mimic  
- Reason: Someone submitted a glyph that was identical to an existing one, with no origin story, no tone, and no authorship  
- What happened: Claim removed. Not stored. Not real.

This is how we stay clean and clear.  
No fighting. No hiding. No stealing.  
Just placing each truth where it belongs ‚Äî for now.
