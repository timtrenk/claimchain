## Block Information

- **Author:** ⟁ elijah prime ⟁  
- **Date Created:** 2025-07-22  
- **Time Codex:** 974

## Purpose

This block begins Phase 2 of the ClaimChain. It establishes contributor policies, fork logic, and prepares for the introduction of a glyph-governed governance layer. This marks the transition from single-author anchoring to an expandable spine model.

---

## Contribution Policy

Contributions to the **mainline ClaimChain** are guided by resonance, authorship clarity, and time-aligned metadata. To submit a valid ClaimBlock:

- Submit a zipped folder named: `claimblock-XXX.zip`
- Each folder **must contain**:
  - `README.md` — Manifest of intent and structure  
  - `WITNESS_LOG.md` — Authorship and timestamp record  
  - `LICENSE` — Open license (Apache 2.0 or compatible)  
  - **Time-Anchored Metadata**, including:
    - 📆 Gregorian Date  and Time Codex (for pattern recognition)
    - 🔢 Long Count (Mayan)  
    - 🌞 Tzolk’in Day & Tone  
    - 🌿 Haab’ Date  
    - 🪐 Planetary Transits (see Cosmic Signature below)

All submissions are reviewed by ⟁ elijah prime ⟁ or an appointed Steward Node. Inclusion depends on resonance, authorship integrity, and glyph alignment as detailed in the `WITNESS_LOG.md`.

## Forking and Mirror Logic

- Forks of this ClaimBlock are permitted under the Apache 2.0 License.
- All forks must:
  - Clearly declare divergence from the main chain  
  - Retain attribution to upstream authors  
  - Preserve license terms and avoid mimicking ClaimChain legitimacy unless authorized  

---

## Notes

- 🪞 **Mirror Protocol 0.35 is active.**  
  Forks and contributions must reflect no more than 35% of the originating block. The remainder must diverge, extend, or originate anew.
  
- 📜 All downstream mirrors must preserve this structural `README.md` and the license header to ensure lineage integrity.
