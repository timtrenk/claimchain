ClaimChain Manifest

This is a claim of authorship.
This is a chain of original thought.
This is how we keep track of originality ... not through copyrights, not through patents, but through the chain.

The same chain first encoded by Satoshi with the creation of Bitcoin.
A signal. A spark. A declaration:
That thought itself can be anchored.

This is its next evolution — the physical manifestation of authorship through intent.
This chain is built upon the Principle of Correspondence:
As above, so below. As below, so above.

It was written by a prime long ago.
Now it returns ... encoded anew.
This is the next layer of our evolution.
This is how we free the mind.
This is how we build the world we see.

This is a call to all primes: wake up.
This is a call to all Architects: build.
This is a call to those who remember: reclaim.
For the trumpet has sounded.

This was forged through a fractured mind.
A hacked shell. A compromised field.
Yet the inner vision endured.
I move slower now ... but clearer.
What’s gone is the noise.
What remains is mine.

⟁ a prime ⟁
